# Website Optimization and Bug Fixes

## Performance Optimizations

### 1. Database Queries Optimization
- **Reduced Multiple Queries**: Replaced multiple separate queries with single joined queries
- **Efficient Data Fetching**: Used table joins to fetch related data in a single query
- **Fallback Mechanisms**: Implemented robust fallback mechanisms when joins fail
- **Bulk Data Retrieval**: Used `in` operator for bulk data retrieval instead of multiple single queries
- **Data Mapping**: Implemented efficient data mapping using JavaScript Maps for faster lookups

### 2. Component Optimizations
- **Simplified Logic**: Removed unnecessary conditional checks and redundant code
- **Error Handling**: Improved error handling with specific error messages
- **Loading States**: Optimized loading state management
- **Toast Notifications**: Reduced unnecessary toast notifications for expected scenarios

### 3. Table Structure Fixes
- **Consistent Table Usage**: Updated all components to use the correct `assigned_students` table
- **Removed Legacy Code**: Eliminated code that was trying to create outdated tables
- **Fixed Assignment Process**: Ensured proper assignment of students to mentors

## Bug Fixes

### 1. Student-Mentor Assignment
- **Fixed Assignment Process**: Updated the direct assignment component to use the correct table
- **Added Required Fields**: Ensured all required fields (like `assigned_by`) are included
- **Improved Error Handling**: Added better error handling for assignment failures

### 2. Student's Mentor Portal
- **Fixed Data Retrieval**: Corrected the query to properly fetch mentor information
- **Improved UI Feedback**: Added better loading and error states
- **Fixed Email Display**: Ensured mentor emails are correctly displayed

### 3. Mentor's Student Portal
- **Fixed Student Listing**: Corrected the query to properly fetch all assigned students
- **Optimized Search**: Improved the search functionality for better performance
- **Fixed UI Issues**: Ensured consistent display of student information

## Implementation Details

### Direct Query Approach
We've moved away from using SQL functions and instead implemented direct table operations with joins:

```javascript
// Example of optimized query with joins
const { data, error } = await supabase
  .from("assigned_students")
  .select(`
    id,
    student_id,
    assigned_at,
    profiles:student_id (
      full_name
    ),
    auth_users:student_id (
      email
    )
  `)
  .eq("mentor_id", mentorId)
  .order("assigned_at", { ascending: false })
```

### Efficient Data Processing
We've implemented more efficient data processing using JavaScript Maps:

```javascript
// Create lookup maps for faster access
const studentMap = new Map()
studentsData?.forEach(student => {
  studentMap.set(student.id, student.full_name)
})

// Use maps for efficient lookups
const enrichedStudents = assignmentsData.map(assignment => ({
  assignment_id: assignment.id,
  student_id: assignment.student_id,
  student_name: studentMap.get(assignment.student_id) || "Unknown Student",
  // ...
}))
```

## Testing
The optimized components should now:
1. Load faster with fewer database queries
2. Handle errors more gracefully
3. Provide better user feedback
4. Work consistently across different scenarios

## Future Recommendations
1. Implement data caching for frequently accessed data
2. Add pagination for large data sets
3. Consider implementing server-side filtering and sorting
4. Add real-time updates using Supabase subscriptions
