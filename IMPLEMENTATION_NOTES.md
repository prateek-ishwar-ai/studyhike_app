# Student-Mentor Assignment System Implementation Notes

## Overview
We've implemented a comprehensive student-mentor assignment system that allows administrators to assign students to mentors, and provides components for both students and mentors to view their assignments.

## Important SQL Syntax Note
When creating PostgreSQL functions with both `security definer` and `language` attributes, the `security definer` attribute must come before the `language` attribute. This is a PostgreSQL syntax requirement.

Example of correct syntax:
```sql
create or replace function public.my_function(param uuid)
returns table (id uuid, name text)
security definer  -- This must come before language
language plpgsql
as $$
begin
  -- Function body
end;
$$;
```

We've fixed this order in all our SQL functions to ensure proper execution.

## Database Implementation
- Created a new `assigned_students` table with proper foreign key constraints
- Added unique constraint to prevent duplicate assignments
- Implemented Row-Level Security (RLS) policies for proper access control
- Created SQL functions for managing assignments:
  - `assign_student_to_mentor`: For admins to assign students to mentors
  - `remove_student_assignment`: For admins to remove assignments
  - `get_mentor_students`: For mentors to view their assigned students
  - `get_student_mentor`: For students to view their assigned mentor
  - `has_mentor`: To check if a student has an assigned mentor

## Component Implementation
- Updated the `StudentMentor` component to display the assigned mentor for a student
- Updated the `MentorStudents` component to display assigned students for a mentor
- Added these components to the respective dashboards:
  - Added `StudentMentor` to the student dashboard
  - Added `MentorStudents` to the mentor dashboard
- Updated the `MyStudentsPage` to use the new SQL functions

## Error Handling
- Implemented fallback mechanisms in case the SQL functions fail
- Added proper error messages and loading states
- Ensured backward compatibility with any existing data

## UI Features
- Students can see their assigned mentor with contact information
- Mentors can see a list of all their assigned students
- Added buttons for quick actions (messaging, scheduling)

## Testing Notes
- Test the assignment process from the admin dashboard
- Verify that students can see their assigned mentors
- Verify that mentors can see their assigned students
- Test the error handling by temporarily disabling the SQL functions

## Future Improvements
- Add notifications when assignments change
- Implement analytics for mentor-student interactions
- Create detailed student progress tracking for mentors
- Add bulk assignment functionality for administrators
