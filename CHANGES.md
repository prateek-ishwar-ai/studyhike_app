# Student-Mentor Assignment System Implementation

## Overview
This implementation adds a robust student-mentor assignment system to the Mark250 platform. The system allows administrators to assign students to mentors, and provides components for both students and mentors to view their assignments.

## Database Changes
- Created a new `assigned_students` table to store student-mentor assignments
- Added unique constraint to prevent duplicate assignments
- Implemented Row-Level Security (RLS) policies to control access
- Created SQL functions for managing assignments:
  - `assign_student_to_mentor`: For admins to assign students to mentors
  - `remove_student_assignment`: For admins to remove assignments
  - `get_mentor_students`: For mentors to view their assigned students
  - `get_student_mentor`: For students to view their assigned mentor
  - `has_mentor`: To check if a student has an assigned mentor

## Component Changes
- Created `StudentMentor` component for students to view their assigned mentor
- Created `MentorStudents` component for mentors to view their assigned students
- Updated student dashboard to display the assigned mentor
- Updated mentor dashboard to display assigned students
- Updated the admin assign-students page to use the new system

## UI Features
- Students can see their assigned mentor with contact information
- Mentors can see a list of all their assigned students
- Admins can assign and remove student-mentor relationships

## Migration from Previous System
The implementation includes fallback mechanisms to handle cases where the SQL functions might not be available, ensuring backward compatibility with any existing data.

## Next Steps
- Implement notifications when assignments change
- Add analytics for mentor-student interactions
- Create detailed student progress tracking for mentors
