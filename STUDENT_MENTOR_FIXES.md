# Student-Mentor System Fixes

## Issues Fixed

1. **Student Assignment Display Issues**
   - Fixed the issue where only the latest assigned student was showing in the mentor's portal
   - Corrected the query to properly fetch all assigned students
   - Added detailed logging to track the data flow

2. **Mentor Dashboard Student Count**
   - Updated the mentor dashboard to correctly show the total number of assigned students
   - Changed the data source from the old `students` table to the correct `assigned_students` table
   - Fixed the active students count calculation

3. **Student's Mentor Display**
   - Fixed the issue where a student's assigned mentor wasn't displaying correctly
   - Simplified the query process to ensure reliable data retrieval
   - Added better error handling for cases where mentor data is incomplete

4. **Performance Optimizations**
   - Removed reliance on SQL functions that were causing errors
   - Simplified queries to reduce database load
   - Improved error handling and logging for better debugging

## Implementation Details

### Direct Table Access
We've updated all components to use direct table access instead of SQL functions:

```javascript
// Example of optimized direct query
const { data, error } = await supabase
  .from("assigned_students")
  .select("id, student_id, assigned_at")
  .eq("mentor_id", mentorId)
  .order("assigned_at", { ascending: false })
```

### Improved Data Processing
We've improved how data is processed after retrieval:

```javascript
// Get student details in bulk
const { data: studentsData } = await supabase
  .from("profiles")
  .select("id, full_name, email")
  .in("id", studentIds)

// Create lookup maps for faster access
const studentMap = new Map()
studentsData?.forEach(student => {
  studentMap.set(student.id, {
    name: student.full_name,
    email: student.email
  })
})

// Combine data efficiently
const enrichedStudents = data.map(assignment => {
  const studentInfo = studentMap.get(assignment.student_id) || { 
    name: "Unknown Student", 
    email: "No email available" 
  }
  
  return {
    assignment_id: assignment.id,
    student_id: assignment.student_id,
    student_name: studentInfo.name,
    student_email: studentInfo.email,
    assigned_at: assignment.assigned_at
  }
})
```

### Enhanced Logging
We've added detailed logging to help diagnose issues:

```javascript
console.log("Fetching assigned students for mentor:", mentorId);
console.log("Assignment query result:", { data, error });
console.log(`Found ${data.length} student assignments for mentor ${mentorId}`);
```

## Testing
The system should now correctly:
1. Show all assigned students in the mentor's dashboard
2. Display the correct student count in all relevant places
3. Show the assigned mentor in the student's dashboard
4. Handle errors gracefully with appropriate fallbacks

## Future Recommendations
1. Consider implementing a caching mechanism for frequently accessed data
2. Add real-time updates using Supabase subscriptions
3. Implement pagination for mentors with many students
4. Add more detailed analytics on student-mentor relationships
