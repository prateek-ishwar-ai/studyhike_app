# Student-Mentor Assignment System Fixes

## Issues Fixed

1. **SQL Syntax Errors**:
   - Fixed the order of `security definer` and `language plpgsql` attributes in all SQL functions
   - Removed duplicate column definitions in SQL functions
   - Made the migration script idempotent by adding `drop if exists` statements

2. **Policy Conflicts**:
   - Added `drop policy if exists` statements to prevent conflicts when policies already exist
   - Ensured proper policy creation for both admin and mentor access

3. **Function Conflicts**:
   - Added `drop function if exists` statements to ensure clean function creation
   - Fixed function parameter definitions to match the expected usage

4. **Assignment Dialog Integration**:
   - Updated the assignment dialog to use the new `assigned_students` table instead of the old `student_mentor_assignments` table
   - Simplified the implementation to use direct table operations instead of SQL functions
   - Removed reliance on potentially problematic SQL functions
   - Fixed the assignment process to properly handle adding and removing student-mentor relationships

## Implementation Details

### SQL Functions (Created but not used directly)
- `assign_student_to_mentor`: For adding new student-mentor assignments
- `remove_student_assignment`: For removing existing assignments
- `get_mentor_students`: For retrieving all students assigned to a mentor
- `get_student_mentor`: For retrieving the mentor assigned to a student
- `has_mentor`: For checking if a student has an assigned mentor

### Direct Table Operations
- Used direct table operations instead of SQL functions to avoid potential issues
- Simplified the implementation for better reliability
- Removed unnecessary complexity in the assignment process

### Assignment Dialog
- Updated to use the new `assigned_students` table
- Implemented direct insert and delete operations for assignments
- Added better error handling and logging
- Ensured proper user ID tracking for assignment operations

## Testing
The system can now be tested by:
1. Assigning students to mentors in the admin interface
2. Verifying that students can see their assigned mentors
3. Verifying that mentors can see their assigned students

## Future Improvements
- Add notifications when assignments change
- Implement analytics for mentor-student interactions
- Create detailed student progress tracking for mentors
- Add bulk assignment functionality for administrators
