# Student-Mentor Assignment System - Final Solution

## Overview
We've implemented a robust student-mentor assignment system for the Mark250 platform. The system allows administrators to assign students to mentors and provides components for both students and mentors to view their assignments.

## Implementation Approach

### Database Layer
1. Created a new `assigned_students` table with proper foreign key constraints
2. Implemented Row-Level Security (RLS) policies for proper access control
3. Created SQL functions for managing assignments (as a reference, but not used directly)

### Application Layer
1. Updated the assignment dialog to use the new `assigned_students` table
2. Implemented direct table operations for better reliability
3. Added proper error handling and logging
4. Ensured backward compatibility with existing data

## Key Changes

### Assignment Dialog
- Simplified the implementation to use direct table operations
- Removed reliance on SQL functions that were causing errors
- Improved error handling and user feedback
- Added proper user tracking for assignment operations

### Student and Mentor Components
- Updated components to display assigned mentors/students
- Implemented fallback mechanisms for error handling
- Ensured consistent data display across the application

## Benefits of the Solution
1. **Reliability**: Direct table operations are more reliable than SQL functions
2. **Simplicity**: Simplified implementation is easier to maintain
3. **Performance**: Reduced complexity leads to better performance
4. **Robustness**: Better error handling ensures the system works even when parts fail

## Testing
The system can be tested by:
1. Assigning students to mentors in the admin interface
2. Verifying that students can see their assigned mentors
3. Verifying that mentors can see their assigned students

## Future Improvements
- Add notifications when assignments change
- Implement analytics for mentor-student interactions
- Create detailed student progress tracking for mentors
- Add bulk assignment functionality for administrators
